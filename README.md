# Development setup
This repository covers my development setup, including
- NixOS configuration files 
- dotfiles to manage my configurations
- some development notes

Thus, the above (almost) fully describes my system state from OS to packages to configuration.

Given I am always tinkering with dotfiles and configurations, using NixOS or even home-manager is not responsive enough, having to "rebuild" every time a single change is made, so I use `dotbot` with symlinks.

> For example, adding a single line in `zshrc` would require a full `sudo nixos-rebuild switch` via NixOS or `home-manager build` with home-manager to apply the `zshrc` changes. With symlinks, I simple save the changes and open a new shell.

The downsides are:
- my configuration is not truly re-producible. Dotfiles are managed separately, symlinks might break, stale links might not get cleaned up
- the upside is a any changes can be applied immediately once symlinkes are established

I have made a sincere attempt to keep this repository as un-cluttered and simple as possible.

I found most dotfiles repositories daunting, with large complex configurations split into multiple sub-modules.
> Whilst this is fine if you understand fully, I do not believe it is a good starting point as the learning process of achieving such a configuration isas important as the result

## Utility script
I have included a utility script `util` to select between
- `os`: building the NixOS configuration
- `dotfiles`: applying the dotfiles symlinks
- `clean`: delete old NixOS generations

## Adding a new devices
I have found that to add a new devices it's easiest to add the initial code for the device on an existing setup **before** cloning the repository. This is because, otherwise NixOS requires the files to be added to git, which in turn requires git's stupid global username and email 😠. All of this is before the nix packages have been installed and `dotbot` run to setup symlinks to git config...

Thus:
1. Create a new directory in `hosts` with the apprioriate hostname, by copying the most similar existing one
2. Go into the `configuration.nix` of the new host and update the `hostname`
3. Make any other necessary changes to `configuration.nix` in the new device (mounts, nvidia, cuda etc)
4. Delete the contents of `hardware-configuration.nix` to make space for the new correct configuration
5. Add a mapping from the username@hostname to the configuration in the `hosts` directory in `flake.nix`
6. Commit and push the changes

## NixOS setup
I have tried to keep my NixOS setup as simple as possible, in a vain attempt to avoid millions of different helper files, sub-modules and overrides.

For configuration files I am using `dotbot`, thus I believe `home-manager` just adds another layer of un-necessary complexity and have opted to not us it

The basic structure follows nix flakes:
- `flake.nix` selects between the configuration of the machine (located in `hosts`)
- `flake.lock` tracks the exact commit of `nixpkgs` so package versions can be replicated
- `modules` provides re-usable configuration fragments
> something I did not know as a beginner is the difference between a NixOS module and configuration fragment, which are distinct!


## Dotfiles
My dotfiles are located in `configs`, where the symlinks are applied by `dotbot` via the `install.conf.yaml` configuration file

Some of the configurations are built from scratch, some based off a templated, or edited from the defaults:
- `nvim` for neovim is based off the neovim kickstart project (although it has diverged a fair bit since)
- `hyprland` is based off the default generated configuration, although has diverged a fair bit since then
> To see the diffs from my config to the example generated one, run `git diff --no-index  <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/refs/heads/main/example/hyprland.conf) configs/hypr/hyprland.conf`

## Applications
The `applications` directory is symlinked via `dotbot` to my "custom" directory in `~/.local/share/applications/`.

This enables me to have custom entries available in fuzzel launcher

## Wallpapers
Wallpapers shameless stolen from [mylinuxforwork dotfiles repo](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/tree/main)

## Keyboard re-bindings
I have a set of keyboard bindings I apply as I find it helps my workflow. In short
- `caps` is rebound to a combination of `ctrl` and `escape` (hold vs tap)
- `space` when in used in conjunction with another key actives a special layer

For keyboard devices such as my laptop keyboard which do not support QMK, I have used `keyd` to remap keys (see `modules/nixos-keyd.nix`).

For my programming keybaords that do support QMK, I have forked [QMK firmware here](https://github.com/joeledwardson/qmk_firmware) with layers added for my keyboards

The additional layer is summarised as:
- `hjkl` for left/down/up/right to mimic vim
- `u` and `d` are mapped to page up/down respectively
- `i` and `x` are mapped to insert/delete respectively
- `p` for print
- `1 through 0,-,=` for fn1 to fn12 respectively
- `g` and `a` for end/home respectively
TODO: use `e` for end, makes much more sense

## Git authentication
I have setup `glab` and `gh `clis for authentication so that i can login via browser on each which is easier

TODO: review SSH keys synchronisation without commiting to git? maybe syncthing?

## Shell debugging
The `.zshrc` provides a debugging variable which uses `zprof` to log the load times when specified.

To use it, set:
```bash
export ZSH_DEBUGRC=true
```
# Nix Notes
Nix is an... interesting language, so these are my notes/thoughts along the way


## Repl and Installables
According to the docs from `nix repl --help`
```
Synopsis

    nix repl [option...] installables...
```

The arg after nix repl is `installables`.

Reading the docs for installables [here](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.18/command-ref/new-cli/nix#installables), it is of the form `flakeref[ # attrpath ],

e.g. `nixpkgs#hello`, or as the `#attrpath` is optional i guess just `nixpkgs`, where we can call `nix repl 'nixpkgs'`

Now, `nix flake show` shows the outputs of a flake, so we can actually see with nixpkgs (i've trimmed the output as its long)
```bash
➜ joelyboy dev-setup (main) ✗ nix flake show nixpkgs
path:/nix/store/bgl6ldj5ihbwcq8p42z3a0qzgqafgk2b-source?lastModified=0&narHash=sha256-LwWRsENAZJKUdD3SpLluwDmdXY9F45ZEgCb0X%2BxgOL0%3D

➜ joelyboy dev-setup (main) ✗
```

Can see now the `legacyPackages` attribute is loaded into the repl! which is from `nixpkgs`.

```bash
➜ joelyboy dev-setup (main) ✗ nix repl nixpkgs

}

```


(FROM CLAUDE)

When you run `nix repl nixpkgs`, here's what happens:

1. **"nixpkgs" is a flake ID** that gets resolved via the registry to `github:NixOS/nixpkgs`
2. **The flake itself** has outputs like `packages`, `legacyPackages`, etc.
3. **In the REPL**, you're interacting with the flake's outputs, not the flake itself

So when you type `nixpkgs` in commands:
- `nix repl nixpkgs` → loads the entire flake's outputs
- `nixpkgs#hello` → means "the hello attribute from nixpkgs flake's outputs"
- The `#` separates flake reference from attribute path

The confusion comes because:
- `nixpkgs` (the flake) contains `legacyPackages.x86_64-linux` with thousands of packages
- When you load it in REPL, you see those packages directly
- But `nixpkgs` itself is the flake, not an output attribute





## Lookup syntax
Firstly, the nix "lookup syntax" `<...>` is sometimes used with `nixpkgs`, but I'm gonna write a simple example here to help myself understand it

Nix expressions expect a `default.nix` file (or a `flake.nix` for newer ones?), see [docs on default.nix here](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.25/command-ref/files/default-nix-expression).

This is a super simple example of looking up my example `default.nix` file with the `greeting` variable and evaluating it

In this case, I did a load of my module `mynixdir` and then executed `greeting` (which was made available as a string from inside `mynixdir`)

```bash
➜ jollof dev-setup (main) ✗ mkdir -p /tmp/mynixdir
➜ jollof dev-setup (main) ✗ echo -e '{\n greeting = "Hello there!";\n }' > /tmp/mynixdir/default.nix
➜ jollof dev-setup (main) ✗ nix eval --file /tmp/mynixdir greeting
"Hello there!"
➜ jollof dev-setup (main) ✗
```

Or, to demonstrate an import, and allocating it to a var and getting the value of `greeting`!
```bash
➜ joelyboy dev-setup (main) ✗ nix repl
Nix 2.28.4
Type :? for help.
nix-repl> import /tmp/mynixdir
{ greeting = "Hello there!"; }

nix-repl> myvar=(import /tmp/m
/tmp/mkdp-nvim.log  /tmp/mynixdir
nix-repl> myvar=(import /tmp/mynixdir)

nix-repl> myvar.greeting
"Hello there!"

nix-repl>
```

## Nix derivations
I'm not hoenstly sure exactly what they, except that they are some sort of enclased part of a function/package that runs/does something??

Anyway, an example to create a derivation, "instantiate" it to the store

```bash
➜ jollof mynixdir cat > simple.nix << 'EOF'
with import <nixpkgs> {};
derivation {
  name = "simple";
  system = "x86_64-linux";
  builder = "${bash}/bin/bash";
  args = [ "-c" "echo hello > $out" ];
}
EOF
➜ jollof mynixdir nix-build simple.nix
this derivation will be built:
  /nix/store/ycdgnli9la2nhmrclldwv3mcckzb0684-simple.drv
building '/nix/store/ycdgnli9la2nhmrclldwv3mcckzb0684-simple.drv'...

➜ jollof mynixdir readlink -f result

➜ jollof mynixdir cat $(readlink -f result)

➜ jollof mynixdir
```

# Mental Notes

```

Thus, for most operations a combination of
- `parted`
- `lsblk`

*should* be sufficient

## Filesystem labels vs Parition Names
I have noticed that the "name" quoted by `sudo parted -l` does NOT match what is mounted, or the "label" in `lsblk -f`.

This is because parted names are `partition names`, stored in the GPT partition table apparently, outside of the filesystem.

Filesystem labels are stored in the filesystem metadata apparently (i guess in a header somewhere in the partition), and is used by automounters.

An example below shows where `Ventoy` was automounted and picked up the correct label name. And the both name and label from `lsblk` vs just the name in `parted`.

Thus, to see what parted gives as well (partition labels) thus command is useful:
```bash
lsblk -o NAME,PARTLABEL,LABEL,SIZE,TYPE,MOUNTPOINT
```

To change disk label is not unified unfortunately.

Shamelessly stole these commands [from here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1103569/how-do-i-change-the-label-reported-by-lsblk)

for ext2/ext3/ext4 filesystems (most linux stuff) can use:
```
e2label /dev/XXX <label>
```

For fat (usb drives, boot partitions) can use:
```
fatlabel /dev/XXX <label> 
```

for exfat (you might need to install exfat-utils first):
```
exfatlabel /dev/XXX <label>
```

for ntfs (windows):
```
ntfslabel /dev/XXX <label>
```

## Mount points

Show file systems with mount points
```
lsblk -f
```

example output:
```

## Linux file permissions
No matter how many times i read about file permissions on linux: groups,id,read,write,execute etc i seem to forget the syntaxes.

So I write (another) diagram to help me remember

### Permission Bits Reference
```
Permission Bits: Read=4, Write=2, Execute=1

Each digit in chmod represents ONE entity:
┌────────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
│ 1st digit  │ 2nd digit  │ 3rd digit  │
│   OWNER    │   GROUP    │   OTHERS   │
│ (you)      │ (your grp) │ (everyone) │
└────────────┴────────────┴────────────┘

Breaking down 755:
┌─────┬─────┬─────┐
│  7  │  5  │  5  │
└──┬──┴──┬──┴──┬──┘
   │     │     │
   │     │     └─> Others: 5 = 4+0+1 = r-x (read + execute)
   │     └─────> Group:  5 = 4+0+1 = r-x (read + execute)
   └───────────> Owner:  7 = 4+2+1 = rwx (read + write + execute)

So 755 means:
- Owner (you):     rwx (can do everything)
- Group members:   r-x (can read and execute, NOT write)
- Others:          r-x (can read and execute, NOT write)

Each digit is calculated:
7 = 4(r) + 2(w) + 1(x) = rwx
6 = 4(r) + 2(w) + 0    = rw-
5 = 4(r) + 0    + 1(x) = r-x
4 = 4(r) + 0    + 0    = r--
3 = 0    + 2(w) + 1(x) = -wx
2 = 0    + 2(w) + 0    = -w-
1 = 0    + 0    + 1(x) = --x
0 = 0    + 0    + 0    = ---
```

### Examples with 007 (DON'T DO THIS!):
```
# Create a file with normal permissions
$ touch myfile.txt
$ ls -l myfile.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 jollof users 0 Aug  3 10:00 myfile.txt

# Apply the bizarre 007 permission
$ chmod 007 myfile.txt
$ ls -l myfile.txt
-------rwx 1 jollof users 0 Aug  3 10:00 myfile.txt
        ↑
        └── Others have FULL access!

# Now YOU (the owner) can't even read your own file!
$ cat myfile.txt
cat: myfile.txt: Permission denied

# But a random user can do anything!
$ sudo -u randomuser cat myfile.txt  # Works!
$ sudo -u randomuser rm myfile.txt   # They can even delete it!
```

### More wacky examples:
```
070 = ---rwx---  (only group members have access)
707 = rwx---rwx  (owner and others yes, group no)
000 = ---------  (nobody can do anything)
111 = --x--x--x  (everyone can execute, but not read/write)
222 = -w--w--w-  (write-only for everyone - very weird!)
444 = r--r--r--  (read-only for everyone, even owner)
```

> For `000`, the root user (or any user with ID 0) can still access given it has special capabilities. See [capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)

### Standard permissions you actually want:
```
755 = rwxr-xr-x  # Executables/directories
644 = rw-r--r--  # Regular files
600 = rw-------  # Private files (like SSH keys)
700 = rwx------  # Private executables/directories
664 = rw-rw-r--  # Group-writable files
775 = rwxrwxr-x  # Group-writable directories
```
## Id and Groups
Diagram of how the `/etc/passwd` file works

`/etc/passwd` defines the user, UID and GID whilst `/etc/group` defines how said users are part of different groups
![/etc/passwd diagram](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*YUNa7sy_Uef9-Of_UvkZbA.jpeg)

### How /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow Connect

```
/etc/passwd                    /etc/group
username ─────────────┬────────► groupname (for supplementary)
         GID ─────────┴────────► GID (for primary group)
         x ───────────┐
                      │        /etc/shadow
                      └────────► password_hash
```

### File Format Breakdown

**`/etc/passwd` format:**
```
username:x:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:shell
```
- `username` - Login name
- `x` - Password placeholder (actual password in /etc/shadow)
- `UID` - User ID number
- `GID` - Primary Group ID number
- `comment` - User description/full name
- `home_directory` - User's home directory path
- `shell` - User's default shell

Example: `joelyboy:x:1000:1000:Joe L:/home/joelyboy:/bin/bash`

**`/etc/group` format:**
```
groupname:x:GID:user1,user2,user3
```
- `groupname` - Group name
- `x` - Password placeholder (rarely used)
- `GID` - Group ID number
- `user1,user2,user3` - Comma-separated list of users (SUPPLEMENTARY members only)

Examples:
- `root:x:0:` - root group with no supplementary members
- `networkmanager:x:57:joelyboy,nm-openvpn` - networkmanager group with two supplementary members

**Key concept:** Users are NOT listed in `/etc/group` for their PRIMARY group (defined in `/etc/passwd`). They only appear in `/etc/group` for SUPPLEMENTARY groups.

## Crypography
So just trying to get my head round this and the various components and how they fit together.

I got claude to draw me a graph

Now the `gnupg` part is enabled in nix by my `modules/nixos-base` with:
```nix
programs.gnupg.agent....
```

As an example of gpg workflow:
1. generate a key for `alice`. 
2. encrypt `util` file to new file `encrypted` using `alice` gpg key
3. decrypt `decrypted` using alice passphrase to new `decrypted` file (which matches original `util` file)

3. decrypt `decrypted` using alice passphrase to new `decrypted` file (which matches original `util` file)

3. decrypt `decrypted` using alice passphrase to new `decrypted` file (which matches original `util` file)

```bash

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

## Character Encodings
Right, I'm going to try and get my head round character encodings (namely UTF-8) as I see it everywhere but have never really understood what it means.

> (I copied alot from [this blog post](https://lokalise.com/blog/what-is-character-encoding-exploring-unicode-utf-8-ascii-and-more/), was an interesting read

### Encodings themselves
It's just thrown around with
- ASCII
- ANSI?
- Unicode?

So a character encoding is the way it's transformed from bytes to wahts shown on the screen firstly (then can come to all the other stuff like terminal escape codes)
UTF-8 is the most popular, ASCII being the ancient one with 7 bits (first bit always 0), and UTF-8 the modern one.

- ASCII: 7 bits, 0 to 127
> Characters 0-31 are control characters (e.g. 10 is newline)
> 128 to 256 is reserved? so we know that its going to need more bytes?

- UTF-8: Variable length (1-4 bytes per char)

Apparently ANSI was a "code page", whereby when ASCII was expanded from the original 7 bits to 8 bits
- suddently we had 128-255 available
- so the other 126 bits could be mapped to a different language based on the code page selected

| Code Page| Region             | Example Mapping |
| -------- | -------            | -------         |
| 1252     | western eurpoe     | ñ               |
| 1253     | greek              | Ψ        |

```
ASCII (0-127): Same everywhere
├── A, B, C... (English letters)
├── 1, 2, 3... (digits)  
└── !, @, #... (basic symbols)

Extended (128-255): Different per region
├── CP-1252: ñ, é, ü, £, ©... (Western Europe)
├── CP-1251: а, б, в, г, д... (Cyrillic)
├── CP-1253: α, β, γ, δ, ε... (Greek)
└── CP-932: あ, か, さ, た, な... (Japanese)
```

Anyway back to encodings.
ASCII is legacy, and UTF-16/UTF-32 is essentially unused (as far as I know!) but it useful to see as a comparison here to UTF-8.

### Character Encoding Examples

**Example: "Hello"**

| Encoding | H | e | l | l | o |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASCII    | 48 | 65 | 6C | 6C | 6F |
| UTF-8    | 48 | 65 | 6C | 6C | 6F |
| UTF-16   | 00 48 | 00 65 | 00 6C | 00 6C | 00 6F |
| UTF-32   | 00 00 00 48 | 00 00 00 65 | 00 00 00 6C | 00 00 00 6C | 00 00 00 6F |

**Example: "Café"**

| Encoding | C | a | f | é |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| ASCII    | 43 | 61 | 66 | ❌ |
| UTF-8    | 43 | 61 | 66 | C3 A9 |
| UTF-16   | 00 43 | 00 61 | 00 66 | 00 E9 |
| UTF-32   | 00 00 00 43 | 00 00 00 61 | 00 00 00 66 | 00 00 00 E9 |

**Example: "你好" (Chinese "Hello")**

| Encoding | 你 | 好 |
|----------|----|----|
| ASCII    | ❌ | ❌ |
| UTF-8    | E4 BD A0 | E5 A5 BD |
| UTF-16   | 4F 60 | 59 7D |
| UTF-32   | 00 00 4F 60 | 00 00 59 7D |

**Example: "Hello 🌍"**

| Encoding | H | e | l | l | o | (space) | 🌍 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|---|---------|-----|
| ASCII    | 48 | 65 | 6C | 6C | 6F | 20 | ❌ |
| UTF-8    | 48 | 65 | 6C | 6C | 6F | 20 | F0 9F 8C 8D |
| UTF-16   | 00 48 | 00 65 | 00 6C | 00 6C | 00 6F | 00 20 | D8 3C DF 0D |
| UTF-32   | 00 00 00 48 | 00 00 00 65 | 00 00 00 6C | 00 00 00 6C | 00 00 00 6F | 00 00 00 20 | 00 01 F3 0D |

**Key observations:**
- ASCII can only represent basic English characters (0-127)
- UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII for basic English text
- UTF-8 uses variable-length encoding (1-4 bytes per character)
- UTF-16 uses minimum 2 bytes per character
- UTF-32 always uses 4 bytes per character (most space-inefficient)



### Unicode
Somewhat confusingly, unicode is often referred to as an encoding, wheras its more of a lookup table?

Introduced asfter ASCII, it expands the available characters.

Most importantly, it **does NOT** specify how to store numbers (thats down to UTF-8 usually), just what the numbers mean.

It is backwards compatible with ASCII, but it typically uses hex to be represented (with U+ prefix). so
- ASCII: 65 = 'A'
- Unicode: U+41 = 'A'

Which are the **same thing**, just normally expressed in a different notation

Just a bit confusing then ASCII is (typically) represented in decimal and Unicode in Hex


```
U+0041 = 'A'
U+0042 = 'B'  
U+00F1 = 'ñ'
U+1F3A8 = '🎨'
```

The typical notation for unicode is:
- `U+0042`, always 0-pad to minimum 4 digits
- `U+U+10FFFF`, unicode maximum value (21 bits, 1,114,111)

And nowwwww, this nicely ties us along to UTF-8, how we normally represnt variable byte information (from 1 to 4 bytes).

Which (not sure these were designed at the same time), conveniently ties in with Unicode, that:
- the max UTF-8 is 4 bytes but 21 bits of data, the same as unicodes max of 21 bits of data!


| Character Length | Bit Pattern | Total Bits | Bits for Data | Bits Lost to Length Info | Efficiency |
|------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **1 byte** | `0xxxxxxx` | 8 | 7 | 1 | 87.5% |
| **2 bytes** | `110xxxxx 10xxxxxx` | 16 | 11 | 5 | 68.75% |
| **3 bytes** | `1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx` | 24 | 16 | 8 | 66.67% |
| **4 bytes** | `11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx` | 32 | 21 | 11 | 65.625% |

### Escape Sequences
