# Development Log
A summary of not particularly concise thoughts, notes and rambles along the way of my development journey of setting up my PC.

This is intended to be for ramblings that are not concise as notes to keep as reference points in the `README`, more rather a log of discoveries

## September 2025
#### Shells
1. Started out with ZSH and spent many many many hours twearing with my `zshrc` file. Ultimately got to something vaguely useful, but it still felt...
- "hacky", like a few weird keybindings entered a strange non-insert state that left me confused
- slow to startup (relatively)
- akward syntax highlighting

2. This led me to fish shell, which just WORKS out the box. but after a while i did notice some quirks that are pretty annoying tbh...
- completions lacking, case and point `git stash` only has `--help` as a completion. not a good start given how popular git is...
- `fzf` extension for zsh just... works, its clean easy to read and actually has all the arguments (more of a repetition of the previous point tbh)
- lacks POSIX compatibility. this is REALLY annoying. its not THAT much better, but writing hyprland scripts (in normal sh) i have to remember its slightly different than fish


3. An alternative option is nushell? could be something more modern that supports data types

#### Vi mode
the annoying alt backspace thing in zsh that enters into a strange mode where i can't insert it actually vim mode! (which is actually useful)

Also, pure has a colour change to yellow on the prompt when in vi mode! can use `w`, `b`, (`j` and `k` to select commands), so actually really useful

## October 2025
Hmmm I should really put more notes from 'README.md` in here (or just break it up better) so I have a concise view of sections and not just random meanderings

### Completion
Well, the completion thing is REALLY annoying as sometimes it breaks and I have no idea why. Taking some notes off claude to try and debug it next time it happens

```bash
# Main Neovim log (all Lua errors, warnings)
~/.local/state/nvim/log

# Or programmatically:
:lua vim.print(vim.fn.stdpath('log'))

# View in real-time:
tail -f ~/.local/state/nvim/log
```

Or for verbosity
```vim
:messages           # In-session messages (cleared on restart)
:messages clear     # Clear message history
:set verbose=9      # Enable verbose logging (0-15, higher = more)
:set verbosefile=/tmp/nvim-verbose.log  # Log to file
```


Or more logs
```bash
# In terminal:
tail -f ~/.local/state/nvim/log
Or in Neovim:
:edit ~/.local/state/nvim/log
```

Or
  :Lazy reload nvim-cmp

Or
  4. Try reloading plugins

  :Lazy reload nvim-cmp
  :Lazy reload noice.nvim

  5. Disable noice temporarily

  :lua package.loaded['noice'] = nil
  :lua vim.cmd('messages clear')
  Then test :e <Tab>

  6. Check cmp status

  :lua vim.print(require('cmp').visible())    # Is menu showing?
  :lua vim.print(require('cmp').get_config()) # Config loaded?

  7. Nuclear option - reload everything

  :Lazy reload nvim-cmp
  :source $MYVIMRC

  Enable Persistent Verbose Logging

  Add this to your init.lua for debugging:

  -- Only enable when debugging:
  -- vim.opt.verbose = 9
  -- vim.opt.verbosefile = vim.fn.stdpath('cache') .. '/nvim-verbose.log'

  Then you can check that log file whenever things break.

  Want me to create a custom debug command that runs all these checks and outputs a report for you?

### Print buffers
So tried a super simple script to print windows and associated buffers as below (can save in scratchpads)
```lua
local wins = vim.api.nvim_list_wins()
local current_buf = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
for winindex, winid in ipairs(wins) do
  print('processing window #' .. winindex .. ', ID: ' .. winid)

  local bufid = vim.api.nvim_win_get_buf(winid)
  print('window buffer id is ' .. bufid)
  local bufname = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(bufid)
  print('buffer name is ' .. bufname)
  if current_buf == bufid then
    print 'is active buffer!'
  end
end
```

and then call with `:luafile scratchpads/...`

Well i've moved scratchpads to a commited dir to git now (except for the brave preferences files). And the updated scripts lives in `./scratchpads/print_bufs.lua`

### Previous boot log
One i ALWAYS forget is to view last boot logs, its `journalctl`, NOT `dmesg`.
```bash
sudo journalctl -b -1
```

### Substitute
Well it turns out mini surround replaces the s key, which would be nice to see the menu?
But claude made a good suggestion just using `c` for change. `cl` changes (left) which is the same thing as s...

### Stylua
While i remember, stylua complaining was nothing to do with conform. It was installed by LSP (for some reason I had added it to list of LSP configurations 🤦‍♂️)
So if i see that one again can just remember to do `:LspUninstall stylua`
